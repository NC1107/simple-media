# Simple Media

The overall goal of this project is to create a way to manage media, in a 'lighter' way, the arr stack feels very bulky
I understand the need for seperation at times, but I do not understand the need for a different app and setup solely for
a different type of media.

## Current Goal

Right now, I want to be able to determine my tech stack, I think its going to have to be react, js and the first thing we 
are going to want to be able to do is create a simple pipeline that builds this project into a docker container that 
we can deploy through a compose and be able to access a website through localhost at a certain port.

## Current Goal TLDR
 - determine tech stack, setup docker container pipeline, get webpage on localhost.


## Notes
- I want this to be light, I'm not going to plan for hosting 500million users and have the most segmented backend
- I want it to be modular, the first media I want to work on will be books. This will come after step 1
